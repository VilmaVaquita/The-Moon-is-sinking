This is the first episode of the Vilma Vaquita series.

[**Play Demo**](http://vilmavaquita.github.io/The-Moon-is-sinking/game.html) (not complete yet, but partially playable)

This game is optimized phones for but can also be played on PCs.

Vaquitas are the most endangered and smallest marine cetacean.  We hope that these little games will become viral and help Vaquitas become more famous and more protected.
